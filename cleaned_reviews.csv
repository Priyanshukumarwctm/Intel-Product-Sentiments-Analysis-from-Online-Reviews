"He is doing fine and is not bad, but with a barely identical computer on the CPU (other brand) I get better performance with the same price.This may have to do with the fact that I have not overclocked the i7-12700K so take this with a grain of salt.",4.0

"Motherboard TUF GAMING B660M-Plus D4 Memory Team Argb DDR4 3600MHz 16g × 4 CPU Cooler DeepCool AS500 Plus Graphic Board MSI RTX3060.Until now, I have created my own 3 PCs, but all of them were used on the B550 and RTX3060 with RyzenCPU (Ryzen7 5800X Ryzen9 3950X 5900X).There were no bugs, and all three were doing games, videos, and image editing, but I was a little worried about the outbreak of delayed delays and some games when clicking on Windows 11.There was a slight jarter in the app, but I didn't care that it was an ""individual difference"" because it was not such a terrible symptom.Meanwhile, I was interested in watching the introduction videos and reviews of Intel 12th generation CPU, so I was interested in knowing that it was faster and higher performance than the previous CPU, so I decided to make my own PC at Intel CPU.The details of the detailed data, etc. are not explained here because they are giving videos and reviews online, but the first thing I was surprised to see from the amateur eyes was that the PC started up compared to Ryzenpc.It became faster, and various clicks and movements were almost delayed, and all reactions were almost steadily working at high speed.(I tried to operate two units at the same time.) In the game, 3060 is too enough, the gorge is gone, and the overall ""uncomfortable feeling"" has disappeared.(WQHD2560 × 1440p high setting.) From this time, it is due to the use of the Intel CPU and the use of the P -core and E core hybrid, the same video used in Ryzenpc, which is usually used during idols and until now.The fact that the power consumption of editing software has dropped is also very good because it can contribute to the savings of electricity.There are only benefits about CPUs, but in other words, it is a bottleneck that peripheral devices such as motherboards are expensive.I think it will be cheaper in the future, but personally, I think that there is enough expensive ""value"".This time, it was a CPU that seemed to make a high -end PC in Intel.",5.0
"The performance is great!During normal operation, the seeds run to approx. 20 - 30 ° C (water cooling 1x radiator) and under load to approx. 50 - 60 ° C.

"Despite a good AMD 5800X, I was interested in this new Intel architecture with performance cores and efficient nuclei.I can say that the result is quite surprising, especially in the application.In addition, it does not heat up too much, from the moment it has good cooling as well.But next to 5800X, there is no comparison at this point.Very satisfied.",5.0

"There is not too much I can say about this processor which has not already been said in countless reviews on the internet. This processor is an extremely capable bit of silicon that should provide a good level of computing for several years.This version of the processor arrives in a card box, within which is a plastic case that holds the processor. It is nothing fancy, and in fact appears a little under whelming when you consider the potential of the product safely held by the plastic.Once the prcessor is removed form the packaging, fitting to a motherboard is very straight forward, although care must be taken when placing the chip in the socket so that no pins on the board are bent, and that the chip is orientated correctly in relation to the socket.Fit a good cooler and you are set for a new level of speed. In my case, I finally upgraded from an older (2014) i7 4770k and the difference for me is very obvious. Everything just seems to happen more quickly now.This has been a worthwhile upgrade for me.

"It is mainly used for games.Actually, I was planning to buy a KF model, but I bought a set sales because it was sold with Mazabo (Rog Strix Z690-F Gaming WiFi) and it was cheaper than purchasing KF separately.I often saw the evaluation of the 12th generation that it was unstable because it was not optimized, but when I was incorporating it, I played the game, and I did not seem to be unstable.It doesn't seem to be the case.If you were reviewing the suspicious advertisement on the net, thanks to the i7 12700K, you could go to the solo dia with apex!Even at work, my colleagues and bosses at work have come to the glance!Intel is the best!!",4.0

Temps are cool at idle, and around 80C at 100%.Cinebench benchmarks are just below a $6.3k (!!!!!) CPU. I bought it at MSRP and worth the money. Even better if you can find it at discount.Something to keep in mind: it was difficult to find AIOs at the time of the review because you have to find a cooler that supports the new LGA 1700 socket. Most brands have some aftermarket support - you can order for free or buy brackets or screws. But check their inventory before ordering.Neat factor: no more pins! I was surprised to find that there are no pins, rather, it's all flat :) If you open your package and find there are no pins, do not panic!Last note: I went from an i5-4670K so this is a massive upgrade for me. But so worth it to anyone who cares about tech to get since it features new core tech and simply amazing performance for the money.I just wish the GPU manufacturers could keep up and sell to individuals or small businesses at LOW VOLUME because to get an RTX 3090 today costs more than 3k EUR which is frankly ridiculous.",5.0

"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",5.0

"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",5.0
"As usual at Intel is very good, the perfs are just incredible with the native boost, I succeeded at the OC up to 5.2GHz and I am sure that we can go up again with a water custom.Only defect is that very quickly when you take a 4080 it pulls the tongue a little in 4K.I will have to change it after 2 years because of Bottleck, but on a config with a 3080 (TI) it must be a very beautiful synergy.

I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all.

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",5.0

So 12gen to 14gen.I really dont see the point in rebuilding a new pc just because its being outperform in gaming at 1080 by the 7800x3d..So overall. If you're new or in need of a massive upgrade. I would consider AMD as it is newer / and should provide you with a better ugrade path (maybe).If you just want whats best for gaming and are planning to stick to 1080p.-Go with ★ 7800x3d 13900k(f)or 14900k(f)-4k Gaming wont put as much load on the cpu, so you could consider not going for the best. It wont make much difference as the gpu will be the one working hard anyway.For anyone with 12gen wondering if they should stick or switch. I would either wait it out to see what happends. Assuming 15 gen will be similar to what 12 to 14 was. So a P-core E-cores config... Or if you're like me and need both gaming and multitasking anything for 12700-13600(i think it slightly better, but you are losing 2 Pcores) 14700 or 13900.

"20220306 Update: I recently checked the CPU temperature during a game and it was about 15 degrees higher. I did an FPU test and it was 91 degrees without OC, it was 75 degrees before! I looked it up and it seems that Intel's 12th generation CPU IHS has a problem with warping due to socket pressure, I got hit by it. As you can see in the picture, all the silicone grease was concentrated in the center. I can't take a good picture from the side, but it was bent about 1°. I put in an M4 washer and the FPU went down to 81 degrees, but it's higher than 75, I wonder if it's because it was deformed. I think it's a problem with both Intel and the motherboard. So far, I'm satisfied with the performance, but I'm quite worried about the durability, I'd like to use it for about 5 years. ------------------------------------------ My current computer (4th generation) is starting to feel a bit heavy, so I'm thinking of updating the parts for the FF14 patch 6.0. 12700k, MSI z690 pro a DDR4, G.skill DDR4-4000 c18, 2x16GB configured, GTX1080 graphics card (I haven't looked much, but aren't graphics card prices crazy these days?) In 4k environment, the highest image quality was still impossible, but I managed to do it with customer settings... but the minimum FPS seems to have improved a lot, it doesn't feel so heavy anymore. This is good for games, I decided to wait for the next generation graphics card. For everyday work, it started up really fast, and Excel felt heavy on my old 4k computer, but now it's comfortable! Other software has also become much faster, it feels like I've skipped 8 generations (lol). I tried overclocking for fun, MSI's motherboard has Turbo Ratio Offset, and this is OK for light overclocking, p-core, e-core all +3, single core was 850 points in CPUZ, and multi was over 10,000! The voltage was automatically set to 1.35v. The CPU cooler is D15, only one fan is installed due to case problems, all cores are +1, FPU is around 80℃, I don't know if +3 is a BIOS problem, but it doesn't run well. The memory is also 4000 c18 with Gear1, and it's pretty stable. It was quite fun. I don't usually overclock though.

"I built my own PC with the following configuration: Motherboard TUF GAMING B660M-PLUS D4 Memory Team ARGB DDR4 3600Mhz 16G×4 CPU Cooler Deepcool AS500 PLUS Graphics Board MSI RTX3060. I have built three PCs so far, all with Ryzen CPU (Ryzen7 5800X Ryzen9 3950X 5900X) and B550 and RTX3060. There were no particular problems and all three were able to handle games, videos, image editing, etc., but what bothered me a little was the slight delay when clicking after switching to Windows 11 and the slight stuttering in some games and apps, but since the symptoms were not that bad, I didn't worry about it as I thought it was just an ""individual difference"". Meanwhile, I saw an introductory video and reviews of Intel's 12th generation CPU and learned that it was faster and more powerful than previous CPUs, so I became interested and decided to build a PC with an Intel CPU for the first time. Other people have posted videos and reviews on the internet, so I won't go into the details here, but as an amateur, I was surprised at how quickly the PC started up compared to the Ryzen PC, and there was almost no delay in various clicks and actions, so all reactions were fast and almost reliable. (I tried running two at the same time.) The 3060 was more than enough for games, and there was no stuttering, and overall it felt like there was no ""discomfort."" (WQHD2560x1440p high settings used.) This time, I'm using an Intel CPU, and perhaps because it uses a hybrid of P and E cores, the power consumption during normal idle and the same video editing software that I used on the Ryzen PC has decreased, which is great because it contributes to saving on electricity bills. There are only advantages to the CPU, but if I had to say one thing, it's the expensive peripherals such as the motherboard that are a problem.

"The Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor impresses with its formidable 12 cores (8 Performance + 4 Efficiency), boasting speeds up to 5.0 GHz when pushed to the limit. Its unlocked potential is a treat for overclocking enthusiasts, providing a substantial performance boost for demanding tasks and gaming. Compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 Series chipsets, it ensures future-proofing and efficient power management. However, the 125W power consumption might concern some users conscious of energy efficiency. Overall, it's a powerhouse that caters to both productivity and gaming needs, albeit with a slightly higher power draw.",5.0
"An absolute powerhouse with outstanding performance. Impressed with how cool it runs when paired with a 240mm AIO, to everything from gaming to rendering processes. Intel hit back hard with the new 12th Generation Intel Core i7-12700k Processor, with lightning fast speeds, remarkable performance, and easy to use overclocking capabilities that makes this processor a champ among the masses. Thank you Intel",5.0
"This thing is an absolute beast of cpu. Great for gaming or everyday work. It also was not very hot, only hitting about 40°C in cinebench r23 and Cyberpunk 2077 with a 240mm AIO.",5.0
"Do you have lots of money? Do you enjoy high end gaming (in 2023)? It is probable that this will do what you need it to do. Placed in a RTX 4070ti build, with 32GB 3200 DDR4 memory. Never recognized any particular slow performance with this CPU, although it runs a little hot. Doesn't come with a fan or cooling device, like most Intel processors.",5.0
Great processor after reading a lot of negative hype on the Internet I have experienced none of the sort my processor has been performing as expected very little issues I've experienced clock speeds hold sustained overclocking was no issue no heating issues by far the best CPU for your buck on the market right now,5.0
"This is an awesome CPU. Obviously not worth the full price when there are better options today, I got this on sale for $275 and I couldn't be happier with the performance compared to my previous i7-9700f.",5.0
"This processor is a beast. Yes, it's not the top of the line, but if you're reading this, you're likely a sensible person that realizes the top of the line doesn't mean the best out there, period. I actually use both the 12700K and a 12900K in separate builds, and I can barely feel any difference between the two. 12700K gives you virtually the same performance, at lower temps and a much lower price. I'd say it like this... unless you already know what specific task you do would benefit from having an i9, the i7 12700K is the perfect CPU for you. Plus, it seems to always be on sale, so it should be a no-brainer. (The i9 does have its benefits, and if you're choosing between these two, read my review for the i9 on it's product page)",5.0
This has been a great CPU processor with no issues of over heating even under extreme and long loads as well as no thermal throttling at high usage.,5.0

"This CPU is great! , best bang for your buck in my opinion! Can't go wrong with the 12 cores and stays cool with my Corsair icue h150 Elite Capellix 360mm ill post some pics , and when playing fortnite , it stay at around 45c and idles at 30-35c! Its recommended to atleast have as many cores as the newest gaming Consoles out there and the PS5 has 8 Cores , so if you wanna future proof your system a bit , Id go with the i7 , but if you really wanna save some money , the i5 is perfect since it has 10 cores!",5.0
"Great cpu, just put it in a new build and works amazing, and easy to oc too",5.0

"I’m coming up on a year in with this cpu and it has been solid. I do plan on upgrading again though because paired with my xfx merc 310 7900 xtx at 1440p, it is creating a bottleneck but with a lower gpu this isn’t an issue. It still is a very solid cpu",5.0
This processor is the bees knees. I have it in both my personal PC and my dad's PC. Runs everything super fast and with a good GPU it'll run any game over 200+ fps.,5.0
All the power I need and overclocked at 5100 MHz running stable.,5.0

Nice high end Intel i7 processor.. it’s been working great,5.0
Didn’t fit socket I was confused with store representative,5.0
"Not a good experience with this CPU in a new build. It does not make full contact with the Cold Plate on the cooler. In fact around 30% to 35% of the IHS in not in contact with the cooler cold plate at all. Almost the entire right side. It may be the CPU is being bent by the Socket that is an Intel socket. Motherboard is a MSI Unify X that cost $500.00 dollars so i am very upset by this and will try to get it resolved. I blame Intel,not best buy. Best buy was great as always so maybe they will help in getting this resolved. Way too much money to just waste",1.0
"First Best Buy rocks for only marking this up $10 over MSRP, other retailers started at $450 and $470 and they were big name places, just shady (but they still sold out). I also got my 10% birthday discount so I was even happier with bestbuy for allowing that on a pre-order. For the chip, I have it with a MSI DDR5 board and memory and its amazing how much better it performs compared to my i7 9700k. I actually had a cpu bottleneck on some games (rtx 3080 ti). mobo, ram, cpu, gpu are all hard to find but if you can, these build awesome systems. I know I overpaid for my gpu ($500 markup over msrp) and DDR will crash in price soon but I don't like waiting to enjoy things in life.",5.0
Intel.. older then i am. Bought the i7 12700k when i was in a pinch and it fit the budget. Read it was good for gaming so took it home and i installed it. Never did have any issues and probably never will untill it becomes outdated. Runs my computer pretty good and seems to run pretty cool temp as well. Its an intel cpu what else is there to say? How do i know if its good? It works great for me and my video games and im sure it would do just about anything.,5.0
"Originally bought the 12900k to replace my 9900k, but decided to exchange for this instead. This i7-12700k offered practically the same performance for 1440p gaming as the 12900k, yet comes in $200 cheaper. It also consumes less power and generates less heat. The per-core performance on these new chips and the addition of the e-cores for background programs is superb. Windows 11 is a must for getting the most from this processor. Windows 10 will not utilize the cores correctly. Can use DDR4 or DDR5 RAM with this new generation of processors, depends on what motherboard you use. DDR5 is much harder to get right now and costs more, but seems to be the way to go if looking for the best performance or long-term compatibility.",5.0
"Stumbled upon Best buy when just searching for what processors were new so I could upgrade from an i7 7700k, and it just happened to be the day after these bad boys came out! Got to me super fast and now that I've received it I never have to slow down in any aspect of my life. Definitely blown away and happy that I scored one before they sold out!",5.0
Good cpu for the price i got mine on sale and completed my computer runs amazing,5.0
1. Upgrading? You’ll need new mobo and maybe heatsink! 2. Use Win11 for best performance due to the 2 different types of cores: Power and Efficiency. (Just like your phone!) 16P and 8E on my 12700K. Win10 does not support Intel Thread Director.,5.0
Good value because i got a price match. Super fast,5.0

I purchased this processor to build a new PC for my wife. I currently have a i9-10900k on my own setup and have an issue with it running too hot (with custom cooling). This i7 is almost on par with my i9 with no overheating issue with just a standard AIO.,5.0

Definitely good for the price per performance vs the i9 12900k which gets extremely hot and not much better.,5.0
Great processor! Honestly intel kinda snuck these out and they really have been under appreciated!,5.0
"Best CPU I’ve owned to date. Sure, the 12900k was better but the price on the 12700k is difficult to beat. Should get a long time out of this one, reminiscent of the old 2500k - long term value for those who keep a CPU for a long time.",5.0
One of the best cpu you can buy at the time with lots of performance. Paired this bad boy up with a 3080 and have no performance issues whatsover. These cpus are power hungry tho and suggest undervolting because they sure do get hot.,5.0
"If your looking for the perfect CPU for intense gaming and dabbling in multi-threaded apps every now and then, then this is the CPU for you. Way less than the i9, close to the same performance. Overclocks easy but gets a little toasty.",5.0
Glad I could take the time to look over everything and got the help to get this product,5.0
"Great product. Super fast with 12 cores. No issues at all, would recommend to anyone.",5.0
"This thing is an absolute beast and the thermals really aren't as bad as people say about 12th gen. I have a 240mm aio on mine and it caps out around 70-75 running kombustor and usually in the low 50s in games depending on how cpu-heavy they are. Idle is typically in the low 30s. Granted I don't have it truly overclocked yet, just XTU's auto overclock which added 100mHz but still. Next, nothing I do can make this thing even begin to break a sweat. Usage in games maxes around 25% in games that'd put my old 9600kf at 100% and start causing frame drops. Overall, this cpu is a monster. Mine passmarked over 36k out of the box. 0 frame drops from an overloaded cpu since I've made this upgrade. I absolutely recommend it.",5.0

12th Gen intel with enough cores to allow for smaller productivity work.,5.0
"I was originally going to get the i9, but after watching several reviews comparing the i9 to the i7, it just didn't make sense to spend twice the money on ~10-20% gain. Plus, the i9 uses WAY more power than the i7. I've gotten it comfortably overclocked to 5.0GHz on a Z63 Kraken AIO. And even at that voltage the CPU temps don't really get above 40c-45c. So far the performance has been outstanding. Along with my 3090 and DDR 5600MHz RAM, there really isn't anything I can't run at max settings. And it runs buttery smooth on my Samsung Oddyssey Neo G9 :)",5.0
"Came broken and best Buy wouldn't let me return it, they blamed me for it.",1.0
It is an amazing CPU for the $260 price tag. It was the CPU that got my computer back up and running and after a month of almost non-stop work it’s still as fast as when I first bought it,5.0
"Wow. So I replaced a Ryzen 5900X with this and for the most part the performance was equivalent if not a little better with this CPU for nearly $200 less than the 5900X. I paired it up with a MSI Tomahawk Z690 DDR4 board and the total platform cost was nearly the same at what I spent on the Ryzen side (granted the Ryzen motherboard was a premium board where was the Intel board was a midrange board). I was worried about cooling since these things run hotter than Ryzen. Utilizing a 280mm Arctic Liquid Freezer II I only hade one core hit 100 in a 20 minute stress test. Everything else stayed in the high 80s. Under normal circumstances and gaming sessions I will sometimes hit the mid 80s which is acceptable/normal for Intel. Since the socket is fairly new be sure to check whatever cooler you getting has a LGA 1700 bracket. The only downside for this chip is that for productivity work, if you're a software developer, you're going to want more cores if you're running a lot of background services or are going to do a lot virtualization. The architecture here really is not conducive to that. Other than that specific use case though, I can't think of a reason to go with this CPU.",5.0
this is a great processor. i have a 360mm aio cooling it and it stays nice and cool while gaming. i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to build a pc.,5.0
"I was originally going to buy a Ryzen CPU (specifically the 5900x), and wasn't even considering Intel since their chips were very clearly inferior... until I started reading about the the new 12000 series chips. Intel finally, after like two years, started innovating again and was going to release chips that were better than AMDs offerings. I'll be honest, I was still a bit hesitant since these chips use a new architecture where some of the cores are slower than the rest (these are called efficiency cores), which kinda sounds a bit sus. Turns out this method is better because those cores handle all the stuff you don't need a lot of muscle for, like browsing the web and watching YouTube, which means less power is consumed and the cores you really need are still there waiting to be used. As far as gaming goes, this CPU has been excellent. Paired with a 3090 it handles everything perfectly, with zero stutters and zero issues. It also runs significantly cooler than my previous CPU (9900k), which is pretty great. Amazing CPU.",5.0
"I love it i have it paired with a evga 3090 ftw3 and have a 240mm aio on it and never breaks 60c with the 120w power set up. previous cpu was a r7 5800x and it blows it out the water, no doubt.",5.0
I always buy the 7 series chip and always buy the k version. This chip has proven to be very stable and fast at every task I throw at it. Have over clocked to 5.2 stable for teating purposes. At the standard boost clocks she hit 4.9 on most instances. Awsome chip and making me really want to try the I9-12900K,5.0

"Finally upgraded from an i5-2500K that was getting a bit long in the tooth with today's AAA gaming titles. The Alder Lake i7-12700K, paired with Nvidia's 3080ti, more than doubles the frame rate with ease, while staying below 60c via Noctua cooling.

"Great CPU. Single threaded, multi-threaded, this does it all. Definitely the sweet spot for Alder Lake in terms of well-rounded performance. If you're only gaming, definitely check out the 12600K, but if you have any production workloads that can benefit from extra threads, this is incredibly close to the 12900k for far less money.",5.0
"I have swapped back and forth from Intel to AMD since the 90's and I can honestly state that all of my Intel PC's and laptops ran smooth as butter. AMD always seemed glitchy and slow to load while doing the most mundane of tasks. Granted its been at least 10 years since my last AMD device... But the Alder Lake CPU's are just amazing. Fast, overcockable, and just in your face! Shoot for first when gaming! Dont blow it with AMD!",5.0
"great CPU - much better value than 12900K! If all you do is gaming I would probably suggest 12600k or maybe even 12400, but I do both productivity and gaming and wanted something that had all 8 P-cores without paying the full price of a 12900K.",5.0

"For the first time in my long history of building computers (over 15 years) I decided to be brave and jump on a new platform right after launch. While I didn't get a DDR5 motherboard to pair this with as I don't feel like spending stupid amounts for a very iffy increase in performance, I think this is truly a massive step forward by Intel. For the first time in a long time, we have a good ol' processor war going on between AMD and Intel. I came from a 3700X and my Cinebench R23 scores nearly doubled. I saw a decent increase in FPS in some CPU limited games. I don't do any real production work so I can't speak to that aspect but, I am sure this chip is sufficient for whatever you may throw at it. To be honest, for gaming this thing is a lot of overkill. I would have just rolled with the 12600K but, I managed to get this for a good deal on a sale. Now for the elephant in the room. This thing is powerful but, it is power hungry as well. Running synthetic benchmarks this CPU will pull easily over 230W. Make sure you are running a 240mm+ AIO or a very good air cooler to keep it cool if you plan on hitting it on all cores. Power efficient under max load this chip is not. Gaming loads are much more reasonable. I was seeing less than half of that wattage playing Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 4. It is an excellent time to be a PC enthusiast (chip shortage and GPU pricing not withstanding). Alder Lake is what Intel need after a pathetic showing with Rocket Lake. I am a life long AMD guy and here I am with a 12700K now. Your move AMD.",5.0
Great processor for the price! It performs just as good as the 12900k. I would recommend this over the flagship 12900k since you are sizing money with on-par performance.,5.0

I think this might be the best value CPU from Intel right now for gaming. It is at least the better value compared to the I9-12900k as it delivers comparable performance at $200 less and doesn't heat up as much as the i9 CPU.

Intel is back! The tech behind this cpu is the first time in the desktop world that intel has changed since 2015 and it shows. Finally intel is back on the top of the charts again and I hope this trend continues between intel and AMD.

"I have always had an affinity for AMD over Intel, and with the last several years being really good to AMD I was planning to continue building with their CPUs. However, I found myself needing a system now and not able to wait for their new AM5 chipset to come out, and I definitely did not want to buy an AM4 setup when it is on its last run. Intel has been doing really well with these Alder Lake CPUs and the fact that it supports DDR5 and newer standards was a better prospect. I have to say I am VERY glad I went Intel on this build. The single-core performance and general responsiveness in most applications is noticeably better than some of the high end AMD builds I have seen. My boot time improved quite a bit, too, which surprised me. I run it with a Mini-ITX board in a tiny case (Lian Li Dan A4-H20) so it is bound to get a bit hot, but nothing outrageous. Overall the performance is excellent and the price is really good comparing to higher end AMD CPUs at the moment. I DID still give AMD some love by going with a 6950 XT instead of a higher end Nvidia GPU, which was also a great call after years of Nvidia, for what it's worth :) This is a great time to go Intel and there is nothing to be disappointed about with this chip!

"The processor is cool and efficient. Using simple air cooling with a Noctua DH-15 (a very large air cooler, I know), temperatures tend to stay in the 40s, maybe low 50s under very heavy load at most. The CPU has done everything I've asked of it without issue and without the need to overclock it. The only real downside is that it's a new form factor, so compatible motherboards are fewer and therefore more expensive. Also, be sure that your cooler has the necessary parts to fit this new form factor. If not, you may have to purchase a conversion kit for your cooler to ensure that it fits properly.",5.0

"I wanted to switch to AMD ryzen but i decided to give team blue one last chance, so I reluctantly upgraded from a Core i7 9700k to this i7-12700k thinking that I wouldn't notice any difference from the previous generation. I was proven wrong, this 12700k is an absolute performance beast. it kills my 9700k and doesn't even break a sweat. No matter the tasks whether video encoding or heavy multitasking running numerous programs. Video editing at 4k is now an absolute breeze. If you are a gamer , this is the CPU u need. I have an RTX 2070 super and was considering upgrading but due to market , I held off. This CPU has extended the life of my 2070, Game play feels more smoother , never dropping below 60fps at ultra setting at 1440p, an example would be Batman Arkham knight which is notoriously a stutter fest is now much smoother and immersive. I don't know how but this upgrade has made my games look better and more responsive. This CPU is a game changer. I have to commend AMD also for this because if they didnt challenge intel with Ryzen , intel would never have stepped up their game. The 12700k is the best CPU intel has made in over 20 years, this product is incredible, highly recommend and also AMD needs to be supported also ,so that things don't return to the way they were 15 years ago.

"Purchased as part of a new build to replace a four year old intel i5 based PC. Paired with an Asus Prime D4. Gets the job done in a quarter of the time! Haven’t tried any overclocking modes yet, still setting up the system. Running with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 cpu cooler, seems to stay cool.",5.0
This thing is nice! So happy to have went this item instead of a step back. Intel keeps getting better.,5.0
I was upgrade finally from a i7 2600k and as I was waiting for parts I returned this and got an i9 instead,5.0
The I7 12700K is a beast at this price point. Pair it with DDR5 ram and you'll be off and running.,5.0
Works extremely well while gaming and streaming as well as photo editing. Needs a beefy cooler though.,5.0
powerful and runs at low temps in a custom watercooling loop. overall im Happy with my purchase,5.0
Amazing IPC improvements. Blows my Ryzen 3900X out of the water. It's really amazing for streaming with X264.,5.0
"for pc gaming this processor is king, it is all you need for pc gaming for years to come",5.0
Core i7-12700K sweet spot for these cpus plus Best Buy price matched keeps me shopping there.,5.0
It gives me no problems as far as I’ve seen since it’s been installed and my computer has never run faster since the upgrade.,5.0
Great processor for the money. Turbos to 5ghz capabilities is great for playing any games.,5.0
great processor. runs nice and cool with tt 360 aio,4.0
"the best price-quality processor in the store, apart from grabbing it on sale",5.0
Great processor and fantastic merchant. Thanks best buy!,5.0
Planned on getting a Ryzen for my next build but reading the reviews and the fact that this has integrated graphics convinced me otherwise. System booted with no issues and we are having fun. Definitely cannot go wrong with this processor.,4.0
"Solid, great, but not the i9 (which if you care about power consumption is a win).",5.0
The CPU is exactly as advertised. No graphics but powerful little tool. 3 stars because it didn't come with a CPU fan. Never had I ever received a CPU without a matching fan... Not sure why they wouldn't include one.,3.0
What can i say? It holds up to every game I've thrown at it so far and pairs with my rtx 4080 nicely. Never gets above 55°c under any load.,5.0
Very good Intel CPU I'm an AMD fanboy but this is good cpu,5.0
Great processor. Works great for the price compared to the 12900k,5.0
This is a great CPU from Intel. It is exactly what I needed for my latest Gaming/Streaming PC build. Definitely would recommend.,5.0
Best cpu all around. I can’t find anything negative to say about it at all,5.0
"Coming from a 7th gen processor, it’s one heck of of an upgrade.",5.0
Intel is stays the king for gaming but still falls behind with multithreaded performance. No complaints it worked right out of box. Nice competitive prices.,5.0
Intel's 12th gen i7 is a huge improvement over the previous 11th gen i7. It offers more cores for literally the same MSRP plus the support for new connectivity like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5. I can't wait to complete my build with an RTX 3080.,5.0
This beast makes the 5800x look stupidly overpriced.,5.0
Great product fair price and very use to learn to use.,5.0
"Great product, got it on sale so made the purchase even more worth it. Havent had any problems with it and havent gotten near 50% CPU usage even when using high demanding games.",5.0
Solid CPU. no problems so far. Definitely would recommend for a high performance build that isnt too expensive,5.0
Got on sale early July. I was able to pick up in store a week after purchase. Working great!!,5.0
Bought for new PC build. Easy to install after making sure motherboard pins are in order. Able to apply thermal paste for cooling easily. Nice for my gaming and work needs.,5.0
"Super fast and cost as much as an 11th gen I7, however finding parts and coolers for it is troublesome and somewhat expensive but still great overall well worth the price",4.0
Bought for my brother. It's pretty awesome!!!! Speedy!,5.0
"Works great and haven't had any problems, Haven't run into a game I couldn't run :)",5.0
Intel processors top tier with plenty of juice and can be overclocked with plenty of juice,5.0
Fast and works great did lots of speed test and comparison to the 11th GEN i9 and definitely out performs,5.0
"Fast, reliable, and runs cool for the performance needed while being relatively cheap definitely a must buy.",5.0
"the CPU works great and is super fast. i didn't really want to pay for the latest and greatest, mainly because i have found that a 10% increase can add 50% to the price of the CPU. one thing to watch out for, there is no cooling fan in this package, so you have to buy one. you can get the CPU with a fan, but it's a different part number. personally, even though it cost more to buy the fan separately, i believe the Noctua cooler i got will work much better than anything Intel provides.",5.0
Great performance at this price point. Always try to go with the chip right below the top chip for great bang for buck.,5.0
"i7 12700k is a powerhouse, all-around great chip. Huge upgrade from my previous 8th-gen chip.",5.0
"Best cpu I've used for this type of money , super stable in comparison with the red team",5.0
"i7 becasue we dont do that i5 crap around here, fantastic dependable cpu",5.0
A solid beast. Great cpu if you have the 30 series gpu,5.0
