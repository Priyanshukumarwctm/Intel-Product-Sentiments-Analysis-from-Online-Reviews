Hij doet het prima en is niet slecht maar bij een nauwelijks identieke computer op de cpu na (ander merk) krijg ik betere performance met dezelfde prijs. Dit kan te maken hebben met dat ik de i7-12700k nog niet heb overclocked dus neem dit met een korrel zout.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good for the price,Reviewed in the Netherlands on 20 September 2023

マザーボード TUF GAMING B660M-PLUS D4 メモリ Team ARGB DDR4 3600Mhz 16G×4 CPUクーラー Deepcool AS500 PLUS グラフィックボード MSI RTX3060 という構成で自作しました。今までで３台PCを自作してきましたが、すべてRyzenCPU(Ryzen7 5800X Ryzen9 3950X 5900X)で、B550とRTX3060での使用でした。特に不具合もなく３台ともゲームや動画・画像編集等そつなくこなしていましたが、少し気になっていたのはWindows１１にしてからのクリックしたときの微妙な遅延の発生や一部のゲームやアプリでのわずかなカクつきがありましたが、そこまで酷い症状ではなかったので「個体差」なのだろうと気にしていませんでした。そんな中、インテル１２世代CPUの紹介動画やレビューなどを見て以前のCPUよりも高速・高性能になったことを知って興味を持ち、今回初めてインテルCPUでPC自作をすることにしました。細かいデータ内容等は、他の皆さんが動画やレビューをネットにあげていらっしゃるので、ここでは説明しませんが、素人目からしてまず体感できて驚いたのが、RyzenPCとくらべてPCの立ち上がりが早くなったことと、いろいろなクリックや動作に遅延がほとんど無くなり、あらゆる反応が高速でほぼ確実に動作するようになったことです。(同じタイミングで２台を動作させてみた。)ゲームでは3060でも十分すぎるくらいで、カクつきも無くなり、全体的に「違和感」が無くなった感じです。(WQHD2560×1440p 高設定での使用。)今回からインテルCPUでの使用で、PコアとEコアのハイブリッド使用になったおかげもあるのか、通常アイドル時や今までRyzenPCで使用していた同じ動画編集ソフト等の消費電力が下がったのも、電気代節約に貢献できてとても良いです。CPUに関してはメリットしかありませんが、しいて言えばマザーボード等の周辺機器が高価なのがネックになりますね。今後は安価にはなっていくとは思いますが、個人的に言えば、高価なだけの「価値」は十分にあると思いました。今度はインテルでのハイエンドPCを作ってみようかな、とも思わせるようなCPUでした。,5.0 out of 5 stars,yasumaki,Reviewed in Japan on 11 February 2022

"Ottimo processore, qualità-prezzo niente buona con prestazioni notevoli per il gaming. Processore stabile e performante. Senza scendere come al solito su considerazioni e aspetti tecnici, che lascio ad altri, consiglio il Core i7-12700K a chi si appresta ad assemblare una piattaforma gaming ad alto profilo, ma, allo stesso tempo a tutti quegli utenti che guardano alla produttività e alle prestazioni in ambito multi-core. Per quanto riguarda al confronto con AMD questo modello si scontra con il Ryzen 9 5900X, molto valido, ma dal costo più alto rispetto alla proposta Intel. Chiaramente consiglio di associare la CPU di Intel a una buona scheda madre con chipset Z690 o Z790 e se avete soldi da spendere ad una buona scheda video serie RTX.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Antonio,Reviewed in Italy on 9 May 2024

"There is not too much I can say about this processor which has not already been said in countless reviews on the internet. This processor is an extremely capable bit of silicon that should provide a good level of computing for several years.This version of the processor arrives in a card box, within which is a plastic case that holds the processor. It is nothing fancy, and in fact appears a little under whelming when you consider the potential of the product safely held by the plastic.Once the prcessor is removed form the packaging, fitting to a motherboard is very straight forward, although care must be taken when placing the chip in the socket so that no pins on the board are bent, and that the chip is orientated correctly in relation to the socket.Fit a good cooler and you are set for a new level of speed. In my case, I finally upgraded from an older (2014) i7 4770k and the difference for me is very obvious. Everything just seems to happen more quickly now.This has been a worthwhile upgrade for me. It was expensive, since I had to replace the motherboard and memory, get a new cooler and added a couple of NVME drives. But it will last me for years before I consider another update.A very good processor that could revolutionise your computing experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars,R.

"Ich habe mir den brandneuen Prozessor gegönnt - viele Alternativen gibts für den Desktop in der Klasse ja nicht - 2 Sockel oder auch nur ein Scaleable/Epyc wären übers Ziel geschossen gewesen.Ein stolzer Preis für eigentlich veraltete Technologie (10nm - wir stehen jetzt bei 7nm und in Kürze bei 5nm, nur Intel bekommt das nicht hin - 7nm wäre der halbe Verbrauch bei gleicher Rechenleistung), der Prozessor bringt es deshalb auf wahnsinnige 180W (lt. Intel Ark), was bei meinem luftgekühlten PC schon zu einem deutlichen Lärmpegel führt, da ich keine Spiele spiele sondern Grafiken und ähnliches mache, ist das ""aufheulen"" aber zeitlich begrenzt und eine Flüssigkühlung auch kein Thema.Die Idee mit den stromsparenden Cores scheint ganz gut, der PC langweilt sich ja meistens, leider habe ich keinen Zugriff auf Laborequipment um mal den tatsächlichen Verbrauch zu messen - das ist mit ""normalen"" Messgeräten leider unmöglich.Ansonsten gibts nicht viel zu sagen, Qualität der CPUs steht bei Intel außer Frage.Alles in allem 4 Sterne, auch wenn man bedenkt, dass mein erstes Auto weniger gekostet hat als die CPU, aber der Vergleich hinkt wohl.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ernst,Reviewed in Germany on 25 May 2022

"Alder Lake is a game-changer. Having E cores helps save power consumption while still performing quite well. Temps are cool at idle, and around 80C at 100%.Cinebench benchmarks are just below a $6.3k (!!!!!) CPU. I bought it at MSRP and worth the money. Even better if you can find it at discount.Something to keep in mind: it was difficult to find AIOs at the time of the review because you have to find a cooler that supports the new LGA 1700 socket. Most brands have some aftermarket support - you can order for free or buy brackets or screws. But check their inventory before ordering.Neat factor: no more pins! I was surprised to find that there are no pins, rather, it's all flat :) If you open your package and find there are no pins, do not panic!Last note: I went from an i5-4670K so this is a massive upgrade for me. But so worth it to anyone who cares about tech to get since it features new core tech and simply amazing performance for the money.I just wish the GPU manufacturers could keep up and sell to individuals or small businesses at LOW VOLUME because to get an RTX 3090 today costs more than 3k EUR which is frankly ridiculous.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hyun Lee,Reviewed in Germany on 26 December 2021

They could make it even smaller, towards a cigarette box or even smaller and I would appreciate if they would eliminate the plastic.I am using it on an Asus TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4, cooled by a Noctua NH-D15.For me it's more than enough and the 20threads are very useful for hobby rendering.I follow the Intel vs AMD comparisons, but my choice was personal. Both have merits. AMD has been impressive in the last years and I won't begrudge anyone for choosing AMD over Intel.I've been satisfied with my previous choice and in daily use, passed the decision moment, I've never come to second doubt the choice.Make the best decision for you, based on budge and use cases.

Habe extra die Custom Wakü rausgeworfen weil ich ein relativ wartungsarmes Innenleben des PC wollte.Läuft einwandfrei mit ddr4 3200 cl14 auf nem Strix Z690 a mit NHD15 S (Achtung Gedreht um 180 Grad einbauen sonst stößt er an der VRam Plastik Abdeckung an) und einer Strix OC 3090 und läuft erstaunlich kühl bei voller Gaminglast zwischen 45-65 Grad mit gutem Airflow im Case.An dem Prozessor gibt es nichts auszusetzen und ich habe für only Gaming und sonstiges Kleinzeug diesen dem 12900k vorgezogen da er etwas weniger Strom braucht um auch etwaigem Throttling durch Hitze vorzubeugen.

"Its worth every cent and theres no doubt about that.The Core i7-12700K comes with all of the gaming performance of its higher-priced i9 counterpart while beating competing Ryzen chips, but it's significantly less expensive. That makes the Core i7-12700K the go-to chip for gamers looking for the highest performance at a forgiving price point, the only thing i would say thats a bit on the down side for NOW is that its only compatible with Z690 motherboards right now so the selection isn’t too big but that of course will change over time no doubt about it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mujo,Reviewed in Germany on 24 February 2022

"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Anish Roy,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022

"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jacob,Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2022

"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all.

As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor.

"I like the integrated graphics as I'm not using it for high-end gaming. I was disappointment to find it didn't come with a cooler. I've been spoiled by AMD. Also it was difficult to fit it into the socket to the point that I was worried about damaging it. Things worked out in the end and I have no complaints about its operation now.

"At this time in the product life cycle, the 12th gen CPU is about half the cost of the 14th gen CPU. It is more than fast enough for everything I do.

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Steve,Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2024

"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Roger Morales,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024"

"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",5.0 out of 5 stars,MSA,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2024"

"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Maxrock89,Reviewed in India on 29 March 2022

"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Andy,Reviewed in Japan on 25 May 2023

"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that.

As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor.

"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ian*******,Reviewed in the United States on 29 January 2024

"There is not too much I can say about this processor which has not already been said in countless reviews on the internet. This processor is an extremely capable bit of silicon that should provide a good level of computing for several years.This version of the processor arrives in a card box, within which is a plastic case that holds the processor. It is nothing fancy, and in fact appears a little under whelming when you consider the potential of the product safely held by the plastic.Once the prcessor is removed form the packaging, fitting to a motherboard is very straight forward, although care must be taken when placing the chip in the socket so that no pins on the board are bent, and that the chip is orientated correctly in relation to the socket.Fit a good cooler and you are set for a new level of speed. In my case, I finally upgraded from an older (2014) i7 4770k and the difference for me is very obvious. Everything just seems to happen more quickly now.This has been a worthwhile upgrade for me. It was expensive, since I had to replace the motherboard and memory, get a new cooler and added a couple of NVME drives.

"Ich habe mir den brandneuen Prozessor gegönnt - viele Alternativen gibts für den Desktop in der Klasse ja nicht - 2 Sockel oder auch nur ein Scaleable/Epyc wären übers Ziel geschossen gewesen.Ein stolzer Preis für eigentlich veraltete Technologie (10nm - wir stehen jetzt bei 7nm und in Kürze bei 5nm, nur Intel bekommt das nicht hin - 7nm wäre der halbe Verbrauch bei gleicher Rechenleistung), der Prozessor bringt es deshalb auf wahnsinnige 180W (lt. Intel Ark), was bei meinem luftgekühlten PC schon zu einem deutlichen Lärmpegel führt, da ich keine Spiele spiele sondern Grafiken und ähnliches mache, ist das ""aufheulen"" aber zeitlich begrenzt und eine Flüssigkühlung auch kein Thema.Die Idee mit den stromsparenden Cores scheint ganz gut, der PC langweilt sich ja meistens, leider habe ich keinen Zugriff auf Laborequipment um mal den tatsächlichen Verbrauch zu messen - das ist mit ""normalen"" Messgeräten leider unmöglich.Ansonsten gibts nicht viel zu sagen, Qualität der CPUs steht bei Intel außer Frage.Alles in allem 4 Sterne, auch wenn man bedenkt, dass mein erstes Auto weniger gekostet hat als die CPU, aber der Vergleich hinkt wohl.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hyun Lee,"Reviewed in Germany on December 26, 2021"

"Alder Lake is a game-changer. Having E cores helps save power consumption while still performing quite well. Temps are cool at idle, and around 80C at 100%.Cinebench benchmarks are just below a $6.3k (!!!!!) CPU. I bought it at MSRP and worth the money. Even better if you can find it at discount.Something to keep in mind: it was difficult to find AIOs at the time of the review because you have to find a cooler that supports the new LGA 1700 socket. Most brands have some aftermarket support - you can order for free or buy brackets or screws. But check their inventory before ordering.Neat factor: no more pins! I was surprised to find that there are no pins, rather, it's all flat :) If you open your package and find there are no pins, do not panic!Last note: I went from an i5-4670K so this is a massive upgrade for me. But so worth it to anyone who cares about tech to get since it features new core tech and simply amazing performance for the money.I just wish the GPU manufacturers could keep up and sell to individuals or small businesses at LOW VOLUME because to get an RTX 3090 today costs more than 3k EUR which is frankly ridiculous.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mujo,"Reviewed in Germany on February 24, 2022"

They could make it even smaller, towards a cigarette box or even smaller and I would appreciate if they would eliminate the plastic.I am using it on an Asus TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4, cooled by a Noctua NH-D15.For me it's more than enough and the 20threads are very useful for hobby rendering.I follow the Intel vs AMD comparisons, but my choice was personal. Both have merits. AMD has been impressive in the last years and I won't begrudge anyone for choosing AMD over Intel.I've been satisfied with my previous choice and in daily use, passed the decision moment, I've never come to second doubt the choice.Make the best decision for you, based on budge and use cases.

"There is not too much I can say about this processor which has not already been said in countless reviews on the internet. This processor is an extremely capable bit of silicon that should provide a good level of computing for several years.This version of the processor arrives in a card box, within which is a plastic case that holds the processor. It is nothing fancy, and in fact appears a little under whelming when you consider the potential of the product safely held by the plastic.Once the prcessor is removed form the packaging, fitting to a motherboard is very straight forward, although care must be taken when placing the chip in the socket so that no pins on the board are bent, and that the chip is orientated correctly in relation to the socket.Fit a good cooler and you are set for a new level of speed. In my case, I finally upgraded from an older (2014) i7 4770k and the difference for me is very obvious. Everything just seems to happen more quickly now.This has been a worthwhile upgrade for me. It was expensive, since I had to replace the motherboard and memory, get a new cooler and added a couple of NVME drives. But it will last me for years before I consider another update.A very good processor that could revolutionise your computing experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars,R. G.,Reviewed in the UK on 27 April 2022

"Ich habe mir den brandneuen Prozessor gegönnt - viele Alternativen gibts für den Desktop in der Klasse ja nicht - 2 Sockel oder auch nur ein Scaleable/Epyc wären übers Ziel geschossen gewesen.Ein stolzer Preis für eigentlich veraltete Technologie (10nm - wir stehen jetzt bei 7nm und in Kürze bei 5nm, nur Intel bekommt das nicht hin - 7nm wäre der halbe Verbrauch bei gleicher Rechenleistung), der Prozessor bringt es deshalb auf wahnsinnige 180W (lt. Intel Ark), was bei meinem luftgekühlten PC schon zu einem deutlichen Lärmpegel führt, da ich keine Spiele spiele sondern Grafiken und ähnliches mache, ist das ""aufheulen"" aber zeitlich begrenzt und eine Flüssigkühlung auch kein Thema.Die Idee mit den stromsparenden Cores scheint ganz gut, der PC langweilt sich ja meistens, leider habe ich keinen Zugriff auf Laborequipment um mal den tatsächlichen Verbrauch zu messen - das ist mit ""normalen"" Messgeräten leider unmöglich.Ansonsten gibts nicht viel zu sagen, Qualität der CPUs steht bei Intel außer Frage.Alles in allem 4 Sterne, auch wenn man bedenkt, dass mein erstes Auto weniger gekostet hat als die CPU, aber der Vergleich hinkt wohl.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ernst,"Reviewed in Germany on May 25, 2022"

"20220306 Update: I recently checked the CPU temperature during a game and it was about 15 degrees higher. I did an FPU test and it was 91 degrees without OC, it was 75 degrees before! I looked it up and it seems that Intel's 12th generation CPU IHS has a problem with warping due to socket pressure, I got hit by it. As you can see in the picture, all the silicone grease was concentrated in the center. I can't take a good picture from the side, but it was bent about 1°. I put in an M4 washer and the FPU went down to 81 degrees, but it's higher than 75, I wonder if it's because it was deformed. I think it's a problem with both Intel and the motherboard. So far, I'm satisfied with the performance, but I'm quite worried about the durability, I'd like to use it for about 5 years. ------------------------------------------ My current computer (4th generation) is starting to feel a bit heavy, so I'm thinking of updating the parts for the FF14 patch 6.0. 12700k, MSI z690 pro a DDR4, G.skill DDR4-4000 c18, 2x16GB configured, GTX1080 graphics card (I haven't looked much, but aren't graphics card prices crazy these days?) In 4k environment, the highest image quality was still impossible, but I managed to do it with customer settings... but the minimum FPS seems to have improved a lot, it doesn't feel so heavy anymore. This is good for games, I decided to wait for the next generation graphics card. For everyday work, it started up really fast, and Excel felt heavy on my old 4k computer, but now it's comfortable! Other software has also become much faster, it feels like I've skipped 8 generations (lol). I tried overclocking for fun, MSI's motherboard has Turbo Ratio Offset, and this is OK for light overclocking, p-core, e-core all +3, single core was 850 points in CPUZ, and multi was over 10,000! The voltage was automatically set to 1.35v. The CPU cooler is D15, only one fan is installed due to case problems, all cores are +1, FPU is around 80℃, I don't know if +3 is a BIOS problem, but it doesn't run well. The memory is also 4000 c18 with Gear1, and it's pretty stable. It was quite fun. I don't usually overclock though. Also, I thought that shopping in the middle of the night is not good, but why didn't I use KF (lol).

"What can I say, I've always been an Intel fan, and I've always equipped my PCs with their CPUs. With stock values, it heats up a little too much but it's enough to undervolt it at OC and the problem is solved while maintaining the same performance. If you want to use it in OC I recommend a nice high-performance AIO or a custom liquid dissipation system. I'm running it in OC with adaptive peaks up to 5.4ghz in P-core and 5.1ghz in E-core, with a CORSAIR H150i 360mm LCD heatsink and the temps don't exceed 75° in FULL LOAD (benchmark test).

"Alder Lake is a game-changer. Having E cores helps save power consumption while still performing quite well. Temps are cool at idle, and around 80C at 100%.Cinebench benchmarks are just below a $6.3k (!!!!!) CPU. I bought it at MSRP and worth the money. Even better if you can find it at discount.Something to keep in mind: it was difficult to find AIOs at the time of the review because you have to find a cooler that supports the new LGA 1700 socket. Most brands have some aftermarket support - you can order for free or buy brackets or screws. But check their inventory before ordering.Neat factor: no more pins! I was surprised to find that there are no pins, rather, it's all flat :) If you open your package and find there are no pins, do not panic!Last note: I went from an i5-4670K so this is a massive upgrade for me. But so worth it to anyone who cares about tech to get since it features new core tech and simply amazing performance for the money.I just wish the GPU manufacturers could keep up and sell to individuals or small businesses at LOW VOLUME because to get an RTX 3090 today costs more than 3k EUR which is frankly ridiculous.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hyun Lee,"Reviewed in Germany on December 26, 2021"

There were no particular problems and all three were able to handle games, videos, image editing, etc., but what bothered me a little was the slight delay when clicking after switching to Windows 11 and the slight stuttering in some games and apps, but since the symptoms were not that bad, I didn't worry about it as I thought it was just an ""individual difference"". Meanwhile, I saw an introductory video and reviews of Intel's 12th generation CPU and learned that it was faster and more powerful than previous CPUs, so I became interested and decided to build a PC with an Intel CPU for the first time. Other people have posted videos and reviews on the internet, so I won't go into the details here, but as an amateur, I was surprised at how quickly the PC started up compared to the Ryzen PC, and there was almost no delay in various clicks and actions, so all reactions were fast and almost reliable. (I tried running two at the same time.) The 3060 was more than enough for games, and there was no stuttering, and overall it felt like there was no ""discomfort."" (WQHD2560x1440p high settings used.) This time, I'm using an Intel CPU, and perhaps because it uses a hybrid of P and E cores, the power consumption during normal idle and the same video editing software that I used on the Ryzen PC has decreased, which is great because it contributes to saving on electricity bills. There are only advantages to the CPU, but if I had to say one thing, it's the expensive peripherals such as the motherboard that are a problem. I think it will become cheaper in the future, but personally, I think it's worth the high price. This CPU made me think about trying to build a high-end PC with Intel next time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,yasumaki,"Reviewed in Japan on February 11, 2022"

"There is not too much I can say about this processor which has not already been said in countless reviews on the internet. This processor is an extremely capable bit of silicon that should provide a good level of computing for several years.This version of the processor arrives in a card box, within which is a plastic case that holds the processor. It is nothing fancy, and in fact appears a little under whelming when you consider the potential of the product safely held by the plastic.Once the prcessor is removed form the packaging, fitting to a motherboard is very straight forward, although care must be taken when placing the chip in the socket so that no pins on the board are bent, and that the chip is orientated correctly in relation to the socket.Fit a good cooler and you are set for a new level of speed. In my case, I finally upgraded from an older (2014) i7 4770k and the difference for me is very obvious. Everything just seems to happen more quickly now.This has been a worthwhile upgrade for me. It was expensive, since I had to replace the motherboard and memory, get a new cooler and added a couple of NVME drives.

マザーボード TUF GAMING B660M-PLUS D4 メモリ Team ARGB DDR4 3600Mhz 16G×4 CPUクーラー Deepcool AS500 PLUS グラフィックボード MSI RTX3060 という構成で自作しました。今までで３台PCを自作してきましたが、すべてRyzenCPU(Ryzen7 5800X Ryzen9 3950X 5900X)で、B550とRTX3060での使用でした。特に不具合もなく３台ともゲームや動画・画像編集等そつなくこなしていましたが、少し気になっていたのはWindows１１にしてからのクリックしたときの微妙な遅延の発生や一部のゲームやアプリでのわずかなカクつきがありましたが、そこまで酷い症状ではなかったので「個体差」なのだろうと気にしていませんでした。そんな中、インテル１２世代CPUの紹介動画やレビューなどを見て以前のCPUよりも高速・高性能になったことを知って興味を持ち、今回初めてインテルCPUでPC自作をすることにしました。細かいデータ内容等は、他の皆さんが動画やレビューをネットにあげていらっしゃるので、ここでは説明しませんが、素人目からしてまず体感できて驚いたのが、RyzenPCとくらべてPCの立ち上がりが早くなったことと、いろいろなクリックや動作に遅延がほとんど無くなり、あらゆる反応が高速でほぼ確実に動作するようになったことです。(同じタイミングで２台を動作させてみた。)ゲームでは3060でも十分すぎるくらいで、カクつきも無くなり、全体的に「違和感」が無くなった感じです。(WQHD2560×1440p 高設定での使用。)今回からインテルCPUでの使用で、PコアとEコアのハイブリッド使用になったおかげもあるのか、通常アイドル時や今までRyzenPCで使用していた同じ動画編集ソフト等の消費電力が下がったのも、電気代節約に貢献できてとても良いです。CPUに関してはメリットしかありませんが、しいて言えばマザーボード等の周辺機器が高価なのがネックになりますね。今後は安価にはなっていくとは思いますが、個人的に言えば、高価なだけの「価値」は十分にあると思いました。今度はインテルでのハイエンドPCを作ってみようかな、とも思わせるようなCPUでした。,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon カスタマー,Reviewed in Japan on 12 April 2022

"ordinato il 28\2022 Dicembre e ricevuto il 30 dicembre 2022, ero indeciso tra il i7 12700k oppure i7 13700k, la differenza al momento dell'acquisto era di 138 euro, e visto che per il 90% del tempo uso il PC per Gaming non mi andava di spendere troppi soldi per la CPU i soldi risparmiati li ho investiti nella GPU e RAM DDR5, ho abbinato i7 12700k a ASUS Prime Z690-P, per il momento sono abbastanza soddisfatto la Prime non avrà tutte le opzioni della Asus Rog Strix che avevo sul mio ""vecchio PC"" ma costa anche 80 euro in meno e visto che ultimamente i prezzi sono altissimi bisogna risparmiare da qualche parte, tra l'altro non ho intenzione di fare OC spinto per il momento i 5 GHz vanno bene",4.0 out of 5 stars,嵐田,Reviewed in Japan on 8 January 2022

"Ich habe mir den brandneuen Prozessor gegönnt - viele Alternativen gibts für den Desktop in der Klasse ja nicht - 2 Sockel oder auch nur ein Scaleable/Epyc wären übers Ziel geschossen gewesen.Ein stolzer Preis für eigentlich veraltete Technologie (10nm - wir stehen jetzt bei 7nm und in Kürze bei 5nm, nur Intel bekommt das nicht hin - 7nm wäre der halbe Verbrauch bei gleicher Rechenleistung), der Prozessor bringt es deshalb auf wahnsinnige 180W (lt. Intel Ark), was bei meinem luftgekühlten PC schon zu einem deutlichen Lärmpegel führt, da ich keine Spiele spiele sondern Grafiken und ähnliches mache, ist das ""aufheulen"" aber zeitlich begrenzt und eine Flüssigkühlung auch kein Thema.Die Idee mit den stromsparenden Cores scheint ganz gut, der PC langweilt sich ja meistens, leider habe ich keinen Zugriff auf Laborequipment um mal den tatsächlichen Verbrauch zu messen - das ist mit ""normalen"" Messgeräten leider unmöglich.Ansonsten gibts nicht viel zu sagen, Qualität der CPUs steht bei Intel außer Frage.Alles in allem 4 Sterne, auch wenn man bedenkt, dass mein erstes Auto weniger gekostet hat als die CPU, aber der Vergleich hinkt wohl.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cliente Amazon,Reviewed in Spain on 16 July 2022

"Alder Lake is a game-changer. Having E cores helps save power consumption while still performing quite well. Temps are cool at idle, and around 80C at 100%.Cinebench benchmarks are just below a $6.3k (!!!!!) CPU. I bought it at MSRP and worth the money. Even better if you can find it at discount.Something to keep in mind: it was difficult to find AIOs at the time of the review because you have to find a cooler that supports the new LGA 1700 socket. Most brands have some aftermarket support - you can order for free or buy brackets or screws. But check their inventory before ordering.Neat factor: no more pins! I was surprised to find that there are no pins, rather, it's all flat :) If you open your package and find there are no pins, do not panic!Last note: I went from an i5-4670K so this is a massive upgrade for me. But so worth it to anyone who cares about tech to get since it features new core tech and simply amazing performance for the money.I just wish the GPU manufacturers could keep up and sell to individuals or small businesses at LOW VOLUME because to get an RTX 3090 today costs more than 3k EUR which is frankly ridiculous.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mr. Jones,Reviewed in Germany on 5 May 2023

"Decided to jump in the Alder Lake CPUs from Intel, to upgrade from the 4 year old Coffee Lake i7-8700k CPU. My computer is used as an all-in-one machine for gaming, work, editing, entertainment.First impression are good. Decent performance for decent budget. Though I wish it would be cheaper.Comes packaged in a simple box. They could make it even smaller, towards a cigarette box or even smaller and I would appreciate if they would eliminate the plastic.I am using it on an Asus TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4, cooled by a Noctua NH-D15.For me it's more than enough and the 20threads are very useful for hobby rendering.I follow the Intel vs AMD comparisons, but my choice was personal. Both have merits. AMD has been impressive in the last years and I won't begrudge anyone for choosing AMD over Intel.I've been satisfied with my previous choice and in daily use, passed the decision moment, I've never come to second doubt the choice.Make the best decision for you, based on budge and use cases.

Motherboard is a MSI Unify X that cost $500.00 dollars so i am very upset by this and will try to get it resolved. I blame Intel,not best buy. Best buy was great as always so maybe they will help in getting this resolved. Way too much money to just waste",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Jonc,Posted 2 years ago. Owned for 3 weeks when reviewed.
"First Best Buy rocks for only marking this up $10 over MSRP, other retailers started at $450 and $470 and they were big name places, just shady (but they still sold out). I also got my 10% birthday discount so I was even happier with bestbuy for allowing that on a pre-order. For the chip, I have it with a MSI DDR5 board and memory and its amazing how much better it performs compared to my i7 9700k. I actually had a cpu bottleneck on some games (rtx 3080 ti). mobo, ram, cpu, gpu are all hard to find but if you can, these build awesome systems. I know I overpaid for my gpu ($500 markup over msrp) and DDR will crash in price soon but I don't like waiting to enjoy things in life.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Nein44,Posted 2 years ago.

Intel.. older then i am. Bought the i7 12700k when i was in a pinch and it fit the budget. Read it was good for gaming so took it home and i installed it. Never did have any issues and probably never will untill it becomes outdated. Runs my computer pretty good and seems to run pretty cool temp as well. Its an intel cpu what else is there to say? How do i know if its good? It works great for me and my video games and im sure it would do just about anything.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Nein44,Posted 4 months ago. Owned for 1 month when reviewed.
"Originally bought the 12900k to replace my 9900k, but decided to exchange for this instead. This i7-12700k offered practically the same performance for 1440p gaming as the 12900k, yet comes in $200 cheaper. It also consumes less power and generates less heat. The per-core performance on these new chips and the addition of the e-cores for background programs is superb. Windows 11 is a must for getting the most from this processor. Windows 10 will not utilize the cores correctly. Can use DDR4 or DDR5 RAM with this new generation of processors, depends on what motherboard you use. DDR5 is much harder to get right now and costs more, but seems to be the way to go if looking for the best performance or long-term compatibility.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,MLBartley,Posted 2 years ago.

"I was originally going to get the i9, but after watching several reviews comparing the i9 to the i7, it just didn't make sense to spend twice the money on ~10-20% gain. Plus, the i9 uses WAY more power than the i7. I've gotten it comfortably overclocked to 5.0GHz on a Z63 Kraken AIO. And even at that voltage the CPU temps don't really get above 40c-45c.

"Wow. So I replaced a Ryzen 5900X with this and for the most part the performance was equivalent if not a little better with this CPU for nearly $200 less than the 5900X. I paired it up with a MSI Tomahawk Z690 DDR4 board and the total platform cost was nearly the same at what I spent on the Ryzen side (granted the Ryzen motherboard was a premium board where was the Intel board was a midrange board). I was worried about cooling since these things run hotter than Ryzen. Utilizing a 280mm Arctic Liquid Freezer II I only hade one core hit 100 in a 20 minute stress test. Everything else stayed in the high 80s. Under normal circumstances and gaming sessions I will sometimes hit the mid 80s which is acceptable/normal for Intel. Since the socket is fairly new be sure to check whatever cooler you getting has a LGA 1700 bracket. The only downside for this chip is that for productivity work, if you're a software developer, you're going to want more cores if you're running a lot of background services or are going to do a lot virtualization. The architecture here really is not conducive to that. Other than that specific use case though, I can't think of a reason to go with this CPU.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,WorstBuy,Posted 2 years ago.

"I was originally going to buy a Ryzen CPU (specifically the 5900x), and wasn't even considering Intel since their chips were very clearly inferior... until I started reading about the the new 12000 series chips. Intel finally, after like two years, started innovating again and was going to release chips that were better than AMDs offerings. I'll be honest, I was still a bit hesitant since these chips use a new architecture where some of the cores are slower than the rest (these are called efficiency cores), which kinda sounds a bit sus. Turns out this method is better because those cores handle all the stuff you don't need a lot of muscle for, like browsing the web and watching YouTube, which means less power is consumed and the cores you really need are still there waiting to be used. As far as gaming goes, this CPU has been excellent. Paired with a 3090 it handles everything perfectly, with zero stutters and zero issues. It also runs significantly cooler than my previous CPU (9900k), which is pretty great. Amazing CPU.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,ColinB,Posted 2 years ago. Owned for 1 month when reviewed.

"For the first time in my long history of building computers (over 15 years) I decided to be brave and jump on a new platform right after launch. While I didn't get a DDR5 motherboard to pair this with as I don't feel like spending stupid amounts for a very iffy increase in performance, I think this is truly a massive step forward by Intel. For the first time in a long time, we have a good ol' processor war going on between AMD and Intel. I came from a 3700X and my Cinebench R23 scores nearly doubled. I saw a decent increase in FPS in some CPU limited games. I don't do any real production work so I can't speak to that aspect but, I am sure this chip is sufficient for whatever you may throw at it. To be honest, for gaming this thing is a lot of overkill. I would have just rolled with the 12600K but, I managed to get this for a good deal on a sale. Now for the elephant in the room. This thing is powerful but, it is power hungry as well. Running synthetic benchmarks this CPU will pull easily over 230W. Make sure you are running a 240mm+ AIO or a very good air cooler to keep it cool if you plan on hitting it on all cores. Power efficient under max load this chip is not. Gaming loads are much more reasonable. I was seeing less than half of that wattage playing Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 4. It is an excellent time to be a PC enthusiast (chip shortage and GPU pricing not withstanding). Alder Lake is what Intel need after a pathetic showing with Rocket Lake. I am a life long AMD guy and here I am with a 12700K now. Your move AMD.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars,RussellH,Posted 2 years ago. Owned for 1 week when reviewed.

"I have always had an affinity for AMD over Intel, and with the last several years being really good to AMD I was planning to continue building with their CPUs. However, I found myself needing a system now and not able to wait for their new AM5 chipset to come out, and I definitely did not want to buy an AM4 setup when it is on its last run. Intel has been doing really well with these Alder Lake CPUs and the fact that it supports DDR5 and newer standards was a better prospect. I have to say I am VERY glad I went Intel on this build. The single-core performance and general responsiveness in most applications is noticeably better than some of the high end AMD builds I have seen. My boot time improved quite a bit, too, which surprised me. I run it with a Mini-ITX board in a tiny case (Lian Li Dan A4-H20) so it is bound to get a bit hot, but nothing outrageous. Overall the performance is excellent and the price is really good comparing to higher end AMD CPUs at the moment. I DID still give AMD some love by going with a 6950 XT instead of a higher end Nvidia GPU, which was also a great call after years of Nvidia, for what it's worth :) This is a great time to go Intel and there is nothing to be disappointed about with this chip!

The CPU has done everything I've asked of it without issue and without the need to overclock it. The only real downside is that it's a new form factor, so compatible motherboards are fewer and therefore more expensive. Also, be sure that your cooler has the necessary parts to fit this new form factor.

"I wanted to switch to AMD ryzen but i decided to give team blue one last chance, so I reluctantly upgraded from a Core i7 9700k to this i7-12700k thinking that I wouldn't notice any difference from the previous generation. I was proven wrong, this 12700k is an absolute performance beast. it kills my 9700k and doesn't even break a sweat. No matter the tasks whether video encoding or heavy multitasking running numerous programs. Video editing at 4k is now an absolute breeze. If you are a gamer , this is the CPU u need. I have an RTX 2070 super and was considering upgrading but due to market , I held off. This CPU has extended the life of my 2070, Game play feels more smoother , never dropping below 60fps at ultra setting at 1440p, an example would be Batman Arkham knight which is notoriously a stutter fest is now much smoother and immersive. I don't know how but this upgrade has made my games look better and more responsive. This CPU is a game changer. I have to commend AMD also for this because if they didnt challenge intel with Ryzen , intel would never have stepped up their game. The 12700k is the best CPU intel has made in over 20 years, this product is incredible, highly recommend and also AMD needs to be supported also ,so that things don't return to the way they were 15 years ago.
